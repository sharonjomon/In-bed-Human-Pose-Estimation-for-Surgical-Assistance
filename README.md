# In-bed-Human-Pose-Estimation-for-Surgical-Assistance
This repository contains all of the code that was used to evaluate pose estimation models on the SLP dataset. It also contains the custom code for wrist refinement.
The original repository can be view at : https://github.com/ostadabbas/SLP-Dataset-and-Code/tree/master
The following files have been modified to incorporate wrist refinement:
